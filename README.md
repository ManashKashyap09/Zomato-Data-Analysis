🔧 Data Cleaning Process
The project includes robust data cleaning procedures:
Rate Conversion: Converted "X.X/5" format to numerical values
Missing Value Handling: Advanced imputation strategies
Data Type Conversion: Proper type casting for analysis
Outlier Detection: Identified and handled anomalies

Handling Missing Values
Applied multiple imputation strategies (median, mode, mean)
Implemented robust cleaning functions
Maintained data integrity throughout
